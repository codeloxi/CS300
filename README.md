What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 
  In this course we used three seperate data structures to load, search, delete, and update bids in our programs. In our final projects we were designing a program to showcase 
  courses for computer science students. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  I approached project one and two by going back through each of the data structure labs we accomplished. I then parsed through each one to see what we had alreay built and 
  included that in the new project. Data structures are very important to understand. In our labs we saw how much faster one data structure is over another. Its also
  important to understand the complexity of implementing a specific data structure. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
  I went back through the labs to see how code was written and how specific things were implemented. The ZyBook was useful for algorithms as well as some coding websites like 
  stackoverflow and geeksforgeeks. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
  Im more aware of how to choose a data structure for a specific problem we are trying to solve. Generally I will keep making seperate functions for a specific thing that must 
  be accomplished. I like having many smaller functions versus having a larger function that does many things. I've found it helps with debugging. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  First and foremost, I like the way we started to write in line comments within functions. Ive found this is a great wasy to make sure that programs are maintainable, 
  readable, and adaptable. I also learned that having the righ function name makes life so much easier.
